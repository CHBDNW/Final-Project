HEALTHY is a full stack web application that utilizes a powerful API to offer a wide range of functionality and information for its users. It is a website that calculates complex nutrition statistics for over 50,000 recipes and food items. It can devise a meal plan or recipe based on what is in the clientâ€™s refrigerator. It can compute nutrition facts including glycemic index for nearly any inputted food item or retrieved recipe.  
It implements a simple and user-friendly frontend coded in React and Javascript, and an SQL back end.   

You can view the JS files in client/SRC/Components. 
Here is a link to a short video demonstration.

There is also a file of the video demonstration called HEALTHY Demonstration 2, my apologies for the low resolution - GitHub only allows a 25mb file.
